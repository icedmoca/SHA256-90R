## Details

### 1. AES-XR (20 Rounds)
- 20 rounds (vs 10 for AES-128)  
- Extended S-boxes + key schedule  
- Standard 128-bit block, supports 128/192/256-bit keys  

**Regression Test Vector:**  
```
Plaintext : 6162633132330000 ("abc123")
Ciphertext: 811d512379011df2da935d8964cd59dd
Decrypted : 6162633132330000 ("abc123")
```

---

### 2. Blowfish-XR (32 Rounds)
- 32 Feistel rounds (vs 16 standard)  
- 34 P-keys, regenerated S-boxes (4 × 256 entries)  
- Standard 64-bit block size  

**Regression Test Vector:**  
```
Plaintext : 7465737464617461 ("testdata")
Ciphertext: c63a9137c6aaa5b8
Decrypted : 7465737464617461 ("testdata")
```

---

### 3. SHA256-90R
- 90 rounds (vs 64 standard SHA-256)  
- Maintains 256-bit hash output  
- Extended message schedule and compression  

**Example:**  
```
Input : "abc"
Output: ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
```

---

### 4. Base64X
- Extended Base64 variant with custom alphabet / Base85 option  
- Round-trip encoding/decoding supported  
- Fully compatible with standard Base64 decoding  

**Example:**  
```
Input : "foobar"
Output: Zm9vYmFy
```

## Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> These implementations are *experimental*  educational variants of standard cryptographic primitives (`AES-XR, Blowfish-XR`, `SHA256-90R`, `Base64X`) that logically strengthen security margins by increasing round counts, regenerating S/P-boxes, and diversifying transformations, thereby raising the difficulty of classical cryptanalysis and reducing reliance on standard attack tools; however, they are **not FIPS-validated**, not peer-reviewed, and not hardened against side-channel attacks, so while they may provide meaningful protection in constrained, closed environments (e.g., private research systems, drones, or IoT testbeds), they should not be considered production-secure replacements for vetted, certified cryptographic libraries.
