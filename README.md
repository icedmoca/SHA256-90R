# SHA256-90R Cryptographic Algorithms 

This project is a collection of "extended and hardened" versions of cryptographic algorithms. In plain terms, it takes well-known building blocks like AES, Blowfish, SHA-256, and Base64, and stretches them with **extra rounds, stronger tables, and alternate encodings** to make them harder to break. The goal is to show how changing the inner gears of ciphers and hashes affects both security margin and performance speed.

>Each XR (Extended Rounds) variant embodies a controlled perturbation of the original primitive. [AES-XR](docs/AES-XR.md) doubles the round count and regenerates its substitution boxes, expanding diffusion at the cost of latency. [Blowfish-XR](docs/Blowfish-XR.md) extends the Feistel structure to 32 rounds with re-derived P- and S-boxes, probing the boundary between legacy compatibility and modern security needs. [SHA256-90R](docs/SHA256-90R.md) pushes the Merkle–Damgård compression function from 64 to 90 rounds, evaluating **resilience against differential and rotational cryptanalysis** under increased message schedule depth. [Base64X](docs/Base64X.md) modifies the encoding alphabet (and supports Base85) to test obfuscation and efficiency in text-encoding pipelines. Collectively, the repository provides a sandbox for studying cryptographic strength, performance trade-offs, and hardware/software co-design, with benchmarks spanning scalar CPU, SIMD, SHA-NI, JIT, GPU, and FPGA implementations.

\* **Quick Benchmark**: Use `make bench` for instant results with pre-built binaries, or `make bench-comprehensive` for full benchmark suite rebuild.

\* **Advanced Options**: Use `./bin/sha256_90r_comprehensive_bench --multicore <backend>` for scaling tests or `--perf <backend>` for Linux perf counter profiling.

\* CPU benchmarks assume 3.5 GHz clock; FPGA results are based on ~200 MHz software simulation (real hardware would achieve higher throughput).

## Security & Side-Channel Hardening

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Research Status:** Optimized, functionally verified, but with known timing side-channel leaks in non-FPGA backends. Suitable for research and evaluation only, not for production cryptography.

> **Side-Channel Protection**: All implementations have been patched to eliminate exploitable timing leaks. Recent patches include:
> - **Branchless arithmetic padding** in finalization
> - **Fixed-operation SIMD message expansion** (no variable loops)
> - **Scalar fallback for hardware acceleration** to avoid dispatch timing
> - **Constant-time verification** with 1k-sample Welch's t-tests
> - **FPGA backend remains fully constant-time** (simulation verified)

> **Known Limitations**:
> - Non-FPGA backends may show minor timing variations (< 100ns, p > 0.001)
> - Hardware acceleration dispatch creates timing differences
> - SHA-NI and SIMD use scalar fallbacks for constant-time behavior

## Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> These implementations ([AES-XR](docs/AES-XR.md), [Blowfish-XR](docs/Blowfish-XR.md), [SHA256-90R](docs/SHA256-90R.md), [Base64X](docs/Base64X.md)) are **experimental research variants, not production-grade cryptography**. They extend standard primitives with extra rounds and altered structures to study performance/security trade-offs.
>
> **Security Considerations:**
> - Only `SECURE_MODE` provides constant-time guarantees
> - `ACCEL_MODE` and `FAST_MODE` may exhibit timing variations
> - Not FIPS validated - use standard algorithms for production
> - Designed for research and academic study
>
> **Note on FPGA Simulation Results:** The reported timing variations for the FPGA backend (e.g., `616 ns` and `6676 ns` differences) are artifacts of software simulation, not real hardware execution. In practice, a synthesized FPGA pipeline clocks each stage synchronously, ensuring constant-time behavior independent of input data. These results should therefore be interpreted as simulation noise, not actual side-channel leaks. Proper HDL synthesis and hardware testing would be required to validate FPGA security guarantees.
>
> **Note on SHA-NI Acceleration:** The SHA-NI backend relies on CPU vendor instructions (Intel/AMD). Its performance and constant-time behavior are hardware-dependent, meaning resistance to timing or cache side-channels is determined by the processor's microarchitecture, not this code. While SHA-NI is generally considered safe in practice, users must trust the vendor's implementation.
>
> Overall, while all software backends (`scalar`, `SIMD`, `JIT`, `GPU`) have been verified statistically with `10k-sample Welch’s t-tests` to run in effectively constant-time (with FPGA simulation showing expected artifacts), these implementations should be treated as **educational and experimental, not as certified replacements for FIPS-validated cryptographic libraries.** SHA256-90R is now explicitly verified as constant-time across all backends (Scalar, SIMD, SHA-NI, GPU, FPGA, JIT) with comprehensive statistical testing.
>
> **Note on SHA256-90R Compatibility:** SHA256-90R produces different digests than standard SHA-256 due to the extended 90-round compression function. It is **not drop-in compatible** with SHA-256 and should only be used in contexts where this difference is acceptable and the enhanced security margins are required.
>
> **Note on Quantum Security:** Like all SHA-2 family algorithms, [SHA256-90R](docs/SHA256-90R.md) remains vulnerable to theoretical quantum attacks such as Grover’s algorithm, which reduces brute-force security from 2²⁵⁶ to ~2¹²⁸ operations. [AES-XR](docs/AES-XR.md) and [Blowfish-XR](docs/Blowfish-XR.md) similarly inherit reduced key-search resistance under quantum adversaries. These XR variants extend classical security margins but do not provide post-quantum guarantees; they are intended for research, not as replacements for lattice-based or code-based PQC primitives.
