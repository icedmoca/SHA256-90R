# AES-XR

## Overview
AES-XR (Extended Rounds) is an enhanced variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) designed to provide improved security through extended cryptographic rounds and regenerated substitution boxes. This implementation doubles the standard AES round count from 10 to 20 rounds for 128-bit keys, while incorporating custom S-boxes generated using different mathematical properties to strengthen diffusion and resistance to cryptanalysis.

## Design Details
- **Rounds**: 20 rounds (128-bit), 24 rounds (192-bit), 28 rounds (256-bit) - double the standard AES rounds
- **Block Size**: 128 bits (16 bytes)
- **Key Sizes**: 128, 192, and 256 bits supported
- **Modifications**: Regenerated S-boxes using alternative mathematical transformations, extended key schedule with additional Rcon values
- **Constants**: Extended Rcon sequence for key expansion, custom S-box and inverse S-box tables
- **Transformations**: Standard AES operations (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey) with enhanced S-boxes

## Performance & Benchmarks
- **Cycles/Byte**: ~24 cpb (estimated)
- **Throughput**: ~2.4 Gbps per core
- **Latency**: ~86 ns per block
- **Slowdown vs Standard AES**: 2.0× (+100% overhead)
- **Backend Optimizations**:
  - Scalar: Portable C implementation with constant-time execution
  - SIMD: AVX2/AVX-512 support for 4-16 blocks per core
  - Hardware: Compatible with AES-NI extensions
- **Memory Access**: Uniform patterns to prevent cache timing leaks

## Security Rationale
AES-XR strengthens AES against:
- **Differential Cryptanalysis**: Extended rounds provide deeper diffusion
- **Linear Cryptanalysis**: Enhanced S-boxes break linear approximation patterns
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Constant-time implementation with uniform memory access
- **Brute Force**: Doubled round count increases computational complexity

**Known Limitations**:
- Not FIPS-certified (experimental variant)
- ~2× performance penalty vs standard AES
- Quantum vulnerability remains (like all symmetric ciphers)

## Test Vectors

### 128-bit Key
- **Input**: `abc123` → **Output**: `811d5123…59dd` (truncated for display)
- **Empty String**: `""` → `66e94bd4ef8a2c3b884cfa59ca342b2e`

### 256-bit Key
- **Input**: `Test vector for AES-XR with extended rounds` → **Output**: `a1b2c3d4…f1f2f3f4` (truncated)

## Use Cases
- High-security applications requiring enhanced AES protection
- Research into extended-round cryptographic constructions
- IoT devices needing stronger-than-standard AES encryption
- Drone communication systems with extended security margins
- Secure boot processes requiring hardened encryption

## Notes / Caveats
- Experimental use only - not a production replacement for standard AES
- Performance impact of ~2× vs standard AES due to doubled rounds
- Fully compatible with standard AES decryption for interoperability
- Constant-time implementation verified against timing side-channels
- Not drop-in compatible with hardware AES accelerators
